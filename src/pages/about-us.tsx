          <h2 className="text-lg sm:text-2xl font-bold my-2">Why was this initiative through the model of Open Online Courses?</h2>
          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg">
            Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) is essentially an asynchronous teaching-learning platform, where the process involves the use of pre-recorded lectures, resource video materials, lecture notes, assignments and quizzes, as content and self-assessment at regular intervals. The learning, through scheduling of fixed time duration for completion of courses and, therefore, the simultaneous participation of teachers and a large number of students may be termed synchronous and is thus similar to a classroom, albeit on the Internet and being much larger in size. When offered with consideration for students in non-urban and rural areas through supplementary DVDs and mobile-delivered content, they enable quality and equitable access to a much larger population of students and can lead to a significant rise in the Gross Enrollment Ratio. These courses are open for anyone to access – free of cost. So anyone who is interested in learning gets access to quality content, which also includes discussion with the course faculty and access to assignments for self-testing. The faculty who are currently offering courses are from the IITs or from other reputed institutes such as CMI, IMSc etc.

          <h2 className="text-lg sm:text-2xl font-bold my-2">NPTEL Online Certification</h2>
          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg">
            The objective of enabling students to obtain certificates for courses is to make students employable in the industry or pursue a suitable higher education programme. Through an online portal, 4, 8, or 12-week online courses, typically on topics relevant to students in all years of higher education along with basic core courses in sciences and humanities with exposure to relevant tools and technologies, are being offered. Enrollment to and learning from these courses is free. Following these online courses, an in-person, proctored certification exam is conducted and a certificate is provided through the participating institutions and industry, as applicable.
